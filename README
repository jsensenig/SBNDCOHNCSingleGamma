This directory implements a reconstruction-based event selection for
inclusive identidication on numu CC interactions in SBND/ICARUS for use
by a study of numu disappearance in SBN.

The directory structure is as follows:

PreSelection: Gathers infomation for a bunch of modules on reconstructed
              objects. Organizes interactions/slices from Pandora, runs
              calorimetry and momentum calculatiosn on all TPC tracks,
              runs cosmic ID on all tracks. Runs as a sbn module -- 
              takes art ROOT files as input and makes a normal ROOT
              output file. In each event, makes a single numu::RecoEvent
              object, as documented in the Data/ directory.

PostProcess: Runs selections and produces histograms/plots for the
             analysis. Tuns as a sbn-postprocess module. Takes as input
             normal ROOT files (coming from the PreSelection) and
             produces a normal ROOT file with plots (no TTree).

Histograms: Classes encapsulating ROOT histograms generated in both the
            pre-selectionstage and in the post-processing stage.

CosmicIDAlgs: Algorithms for identification of cosmic muons. Originally
              implemented by Tom Brooks for SBND. Ported by me into
              sbncode.

Data: Contains all the data produced by the PreSelection module. The
      entrypoint is the RecoEvent class. All units of the data are
      GeV/cm/us. Any deviation from this is a bug.

DataProductViewers: Small modules for printing information associated
                    with LArSoft data products. Each is run as an
                    individual sbn module.

LArReco: Modules copied from larreco for use by the PreSelection.

OpHitFinder: A copy of the SBND optical hit finder for use by the
             Preselection.

RecoUtils: A copy of the sbndcode RecoUtils directory ported to sbncode
           for use by the preselection.

fcl: Configuration files

grid: Scripts for running on the grid

plots: Python scripts for making plots out of the histograms produced by
       the PostProcess module.

RUNNING THE CODE:

PreSelection:

	sbn -m SBNOscReco_NumuReco -c fcl/NumuRecoSBND.fcl <input files>

Where <input files> are a set of art ROOT files that have been run
through the full SBND/ICARUS reconstruction chain. It is possible to
specify the <input files> as a filelist using some file the ends in
".list".

To run in ICARUS, use the fcl: NumuRecoICARUS.fcl.

Post Process:
	sbn-postprocess -m SBNOscReco_Selection -c fcl/SBNDSelection.fcl <input files>

Where <input files> are a set of normal ROOT files that have been
produced by the SBNOscReco_NumuReco pre-selection moudle.

To run in ICARUS, use the fcl: ICARUSSelection.fcl.

On the grid:

First copy the build/ directory into your localproducts area. Then tar
up the local products area. On the grid, run a scipt that untars and
runs the setup_sbnanalysis.sh script, and make sure that the
SBN_ANALYSIS_DIR path set in that script is changed correctly. In terms
of commands:

cp -r path/to/sbncode/sbnalysis/build path/to/localproducts/sbncode/sbnanalysis
tar -zcvf path/to/tars/sbncode.tar.gz path/to/localproducts/*


Make sure you change the first line of setup_sbnanalysis.sh from (e.g.):

export SBN_ANALYSIS_DIR=/sbnd/app/users/gputnam/sbndcode/srcs/sbncode/sbnanalysis/build # Absolute path

to:

export SBN_ANALYSIS_DIR=./sbncode/sbnanalysis # Relative path as on grid

And in the grid script, source this file. Note that all configuration
files and filelists needed by the analysis are copied into the
sbnanalysis build/ directory in the build/fcl and build/files
directories respectively. The the submit_combined.sh script in the
grid/ directory for an example of how to run the analysis on the grid.
